# ABOUT page

Hello, our team is named The M&M, standing for Matthew W. and Matthew M. I'm
Matthew W, and this is our project, _SpookySnack Picker_.

The goal of our project was to allow people to pick out a bowl of candy to give
out on Halloween. Say you weren't going to be home for Halloween and wanted to
just leave a bowl out for people. _SpookySnack Picker_ chooses a random list of
items for you from each of nine sections so nobody will feel left out, no matter
their taste in candy.

# SPOOKYSNACK PICKER page

The sections of candy that we have are as follows:

- Chocolate
- Fruit
- Caramel
- Peanut or Almond
- Nougat
- Crisped Rice
- Hard candy (lollipops, etc)
- Bar candy (kitkats, etc)
- Pluribus candy (anything which you get multiple pieces of, like M&Ms)

We can generate a new 'bowl' of candy by reloading the page or clicking the
"GENERATE NEW BOWL" button.

If we had more time, we would have liked to add an 'editor' of sorts, to allow
you to generate a bowl then fine-tune it to something you think is better.

# DATASET page

All of our information comes from a small dataset of snacks, in which all of our
sections of candy are listed, as well as a small bit more data.

For sugar amount, this is just how much sugar is in the candy in comparison to
all of the other candies, as a percentile.

Price is similar to sugar, it's just a comparison of how much each candy costs
as a percentile.

Popularity is based on a 'win percentage' where surveys were given to people
with two random candies on it, and they decided which one they liked better.
More wins means a higher popularity.

We implemented a search function to allow us to search for items if you wish to
know more about an item as well. Originally it was going to be used for the
editor so you can search for specific candies, but we never got to that.

For example, we can search "M&Ms" and get all of the results for that.

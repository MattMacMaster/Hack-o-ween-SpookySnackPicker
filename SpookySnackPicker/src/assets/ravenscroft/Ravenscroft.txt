UPDATE v1.2: Enhanced versions of the Haunted Mansion logos and "The" dingbat

UPDATE v1.1: Corrected wallpaper patterns, added new "@" symbol

<<===========>>

Ravenscroft was inspired by the lettering used around Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions. The characters were drawn by Kronos (TombSweetTomb.com) and together we put them into a font filled with alternate letters, logos, and dingbats.
